## üí° Overview

Previous single-query iterative methods suffer from high latency, inefficient workflows, and poor scalability in exhaustive searching across a large number of documents. In contrast, this work empowers an LRM to integrate parallel and sequential search by training it to distinguish between parallelizable and sequential queries. This integration of parallel and sequential search improves both efficiency and accuracy.

### ‚ú® Dataset

Existing multi-step QA datasets focus mainly on sequential retrieval, leaving parallelizable scenarios underexplored. To fill this gap, this work introduces HDS-QA, a dataset of hybrid-hop questions that mix parallelizable and sequential subqueries. It also includes synthetic answer trajectories that guide models through reasoning, querying, and retrieval loops involving parallel queries.

### ‚ú® Method

The authors present HybridDeepSearcher, an LRM fine-tuned on HDS-QA that integrates parallel querying into sequential reasoning, reducing iterations and improving coherence through visualized reasoning and planning steps. Experiments on a subset of BrowseComp show it achieves higher F1 scores with fewer sequential searches and API calls than baselines, while scaling effectively as the search budget increases. Its dynamic retrieval strategies and adaptive workflows enable efficient handling of large document sets for complex questions.
